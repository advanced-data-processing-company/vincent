# HEAD
#   <type> the type of the made changes. Should be one of:
#       feat        some feature development
#       fix         bug fix
#       docs        changes in documentation
#       style       formatting changes
#       refactor    changes those do not fix a bug or implement a feature. Simple refactoring
#       test        changes to tests or addition of new ones
#       chore       any other changes, not affecting code
#   <scope> - here you define the scope of changes. 
#        For example: featureA, buildConfig, or any other scope you can think of.
#   <subject> - there are different methodologies to write the subject, but the main rules are as follows:
#       use imperative, present tense. “fix” not “fixed”, “add” not “added”. By the way, 
#       Git also uses this convention for its own pre-formateed messages(“Merge pull request…”).
#       don’t capitalize first letter
#       do not add dot(.) at the end of subject
# BODY
#   anything you wanto to add,detail of what you did,effect,scope...
# FOOTER
#   feature/bug number
